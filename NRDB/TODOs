- app name/icon?

- import: parse text-based decks?
- card distribution stats
- win/loss statistics

- set selection: group by cycles (expand/collapse?)
- share via airdrop
- filter: show results instead of deck

- images needed: cardPlaceholder, credit/str/mu/trash/ap icons
- preload all card images? (and don't invalidate cache?)
