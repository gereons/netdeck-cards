            <strong>Quick Start</strong><br/>
            <p>
            When you initially install Net Deck, you will need to at least download the card data from <a href="http://netrunnerdb.com">netrunnerdb.com</a>.
            You can optionally also download all available images in advance, useful when you plan on using the app while offline or on a slow GSM/Edge connection. Missing images
            will be automatically downloaded when needed.
            </p>
            <p>
            To import decks from other sources, you have several options:
            <ul>
                <li>Connect the app to your Dropbox account, copy the Deck files (.o8d) to the &ldquo;Apps/Net Deck&rdquo; folder of your Dropbox, then tap on &ldquo;Import Decks&rdquo;.</li>
                <li>Copy a deck list from Safari, Mail etc to your clipboard. On the next app start, you will be asked if you want to import that deck.</li>
                <li>Copy a netrunnerdb.com or netrunner.meteor.com decklist URL to your clipboard. On the next app start, you will be asked if you want to download and import that deck.</li>
                <li>Connect to your NetrunnerDB.com account to easily exchange decks between the app and the website.</li>
            </ul>
